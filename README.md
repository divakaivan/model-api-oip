# 5/lint-test-completed

## Tests

You can check the test cases I implemented in the `tests/unit_tests` folder.

To run the tests, run `pytest` from the root project dir in your terminal.

## Linting

I hope you found some cool pre-commit hooks. ruff specifically can not only lint but also format files automatically which is very handy (imo).

To run all the pre-commit hooks manually, you can run `pre-commit run --all-files`. Otherwise they will run automatically when you try to commit new files.
